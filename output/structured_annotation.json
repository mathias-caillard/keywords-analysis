        "abstract": "In South Korean universities, the number of international students, particularly from Asian countries, has been on the rise. Despite this growing presence, the expected increase in linguistic diversity on campuses has not been observed. This paper explores the perceptions of both domestic and international students regarding the presence of multilingual signage on and near campus, as well as their perceived reasons for its absence. For this purpose, the students of two universities with similar sizes and language policies were interviewed. The analysis of ethnographic interviews reveals that they only minimally experience the internationalization of universities and the presence of multilingual signage. The prevailing ideology of English as a global language and the marginalized status of international students are stated as key reasons for the lack of multilingual signage. Even international students do not feel a strong need for such signage, given the widespread use of online communities, machine translation technology, and immersive learning of Korean language and culture. However, they also see potential in multilingual signs as tools for university branding and as emotional support for international students. This paper argues that multilingual signage in internationalized universities should be considered not just as communicative tools for information sharing and commanding, but as affective resources for branding and belonging among international students.",

        "abstract": "South Korean universities have undergone a significant transformation into culturally and ethnically diverse spaces due to the increasing influx of international students, driven by institutional efforts toward internationalization in higher education. This paper examines the impacts of this sociocultural change on the sociolinguistic environments within internationalizing universities, with a specific focus on the role of multilingualism in shaping linguistic landscape. In this study, four universities with distinct types and internationalization policies were selected. Through multiple fieldwork, documents regarding the demographics of international students and language policies, and multilingual signage in and out of campus were collected. The analysis reveals that, regardless of the university types, English signage emerged as the dominant linguistic landscape. Multilingual signs were identified, but they often exhibited low material quality and were strategically placed in specific locations. The prevailing multilingual signage primarily served top-down, informative, and directive functions. A limited number of bottom-up, expressive, and translingual signs were only observed in areas where everyday multiculturalism was allowed and experienced. This study suggests that the mere increase in cultural and ethnic diversity within these institutions does not automatically result in linguistic diversity. In conclusion, this paper underscores the need for deliberate efforts to enhance linguistic diversity within internationalizing South Korean universities.",

        "abstract": "Mongolia is considered a representative country that successfully attempted regime change. Based on fieldwork, this study examines recent geographical changes in Mongolia in terms of land landscape, language landscape, and residential landscape. As changes occur in the commonality of land, which is the most important characteristic of nomadic society, changes in the land landscape of Mongolia today are occurring, such as strengthening boundaries and territorialization, and the coexistence of pastoralism and cultivation. Even in the linguistic landscape centered on the Cyrillic alphabet, multi-character linguistic landscapes such as East Asian languages appear, and in particular, landscapes showing changes in status between the Cyrillic alphabet and English are also observed. Ger, Mongolia’s traditional residential style, goes beyond its significance as a folklore material and maintains its value and inertia as an important residential form, regardless of whether it is a village or a city, even in modern times. However, changes are also occurring in gers, with modern conveniences and tools.

        "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to provide a foundation and the solution for development of the language landscape by analyzing the publicly available language landscape data of the Yanbian Korean-Chinese Autonomous Prefecture, which shows the appearance of a multilingual society. Due to the recent change in the language policy of the Yanbian Korean-Chinese Autonomous Prefecture, the signage regulations have been newly changed, which is expected to have a great impact on the language landscape of the region as well as the usage pattern of the language. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to secure comparative data with future changes by analyzing the language landscape at this point in time from various perspectives. The survey consisted of three regions, Yanji, Hunchun, and Helong, which differed in population distribution and economic development to some extent, and statistically analyzed the aspects of code selection and arrangement, and dealt with the language status, language norms, and translation issues that appeared in the combination of Korean and Chinese languages. Through regional contrast and analysis, the basis of the language landscape was revealed, and the direction of the development of the language landscape was suggested. This paper is expected to be used as an important material for historical sociolinguistic research and the establishment of national resident language policies.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to analyze the socioeconomic and cultural functions of Hangeul in the current multilingual linguistic landscape of Osaka's Ikuno-ku Koreatown, a Korean-Japanese residential area formed in the early 20th century and still active in the 2020s. It also seeks to interpret the role of Hangeul in the linguistic landscape of Korean-Japanese residential areas in Japan from a sociolinguistic perspective. The research methodology involved on-site surveys, analysis of Google Maps Street View images, and comparison with real-time footage from YouTube channels and personal SNS photos taken after 2023. The results indicate that the linguistic landscape is primarily composed of characters comprehensible to Japanese consumers, with a significant proportion of Kanji, Katakana, and Hiragana, reflecting the language use of second and third-generation Korean-Japanese descendants. Comparison of linguistic landscape photos from 2020 and 2023-2024 reveals an increase in direct Hangeul exposure, which can be interpreted as a response to the shift in consumer base from traditional Korean-Japanese customers to tourists interested in Korean culture. The influx of Korean franchises with direct capital investment from Korea is also associated with the increased presence of Hangeul in the linguistic landscape. This trend reflects the influence of consumer demands and economic interests on character usage in commercial areas. If the exposure to Hangeul continues to be a significant factor in attracting customers to Koreatown, it is anticipated that the frequency of Hangeul usage in the area's linguistic landscape will further increase.",

        "abstract": "Despite being a multicultural nation, New Zealand officially promotes itself as a bicultural nation, emphasizing the cultures of both the indigenous Māori people and British settlers. New Zealand also uniquely adopts both English and Māori as official languages. This distinctive sociocultural framework has been successful in fostering social cohesion among the diverse ethnicities in New Zealand, despite its relatively short history. Additionally, New Zealand maintains its reputation as an environmentally advanced and eco-friendly nation embracing the Māori spirit of environmental conservation. Drawing from a review of pertinent literature, this study aims to investigate the historical and social background that has shaped New Zealand’s current regional characteristics. Firstly, it provides an overview of the historical and social background from the initial settlement by the Māori to the present. Secondly, it explores history education, language policies, and various cultural programs aimed at fostering biculturalism as a central tenet in New Zealand. Lastly, it examines eco-friendly policies rooted in the united environmental perspectives of British settlers and the Māori, along with their outcomes. The Māori, who settled first in the land, endured and resisted harsh trials during the process of British colonization while preserving their unique cultural heritage and a spirit of love for nature. Reflecting on the history of conquest through inevitable armed conflicts, British settlers acknowledged and compensated for the injustices inflicted upon the Māori and adopted a policy of biculturalism that positions the Māori alongside British settlers at the heart of the nation. Simultaneously, New Zealand respected the cultures of immigrants from other cultural spheres and collaborated with them. Furthermore, embracing the Māori environmental conservation ethos, New Zealand pursued eco-friendly policies as a driving force for future economic development as an environmentally advanced nation. New Zealand appears to set forth a model for advancing into a mutually thriving community by respecting the identities and cultures of other nations and cooperating with them.",

The findings reveal that Korean, Chinese, and English are predominantly used, each serving different functions and symbolic meanings. Korean is mainly used for informational purposes, while Chinese represents cultural identity and connectivity. The research also investigates language use nuances, such as differences between simplified and traditional Chinese and local signage names. This analysis highlights the diversity and complexity of identities within Korea's old overseas Chinese community.

The first rea is a fact- finding survey of signboard language, and Japanese signboards (Japanese restaurants) in seven large cities nationwide were analyzed in terms of language types and notation types. As a result of the analysis, a total of 18 types appeared in the form of character-specific notation of Japanese signboard language. 1.) Korean, 2.) Korean + Chinese characters, 3.) Korean + Hiragana, 4.) Korean + Chinese + Hiragana, and 5.) Korean + Roman characters, in the order of frequency. The second area is a consciousness survey of Japanese signboards, which conducted a survey of college students and middle-aged people. The main results are as follows: (1) When looking at signs written in hiragana or katakana at restaurants and buildings in the cities, 69.4% of middle-aged people said they were reluctant to the signboards written in Japanese, a rather high proportion compared to the proportion of college students (49.3%). (2) Based on the questions about how Japanese signs on the streets should change in the future, it was found that both college students and middle-aged people prefer signboards written in both Japanese and Korean. (3) Japanese signboards commonly evoke several images such as ‘international’, ‘expensive’, and ‘delicious’, regardless of generation, and the image of ‘looking young’ is predominant in the middle-aged group.",

Since these signs mirror the culture of the university town, we can delineate the characteristics of the area around Pusan National University by examining the types of characters and languages used, as well as the distribution of sign contents based on business types, with the goal of identifying regional peculiarities. The analysis yielded notable findings. Firstly, it was observed that the signage predominantly employs a combination of the Roman alphabet and Hangeul, with the latter being the most prevalent. Secondly, variations in each location were attributed to differences in the market and the primary customer base.

        "abstract": "This study examines the phenomenon of multilingualism within Korean society, with a particular focus on exploring the multilingual landscape within the Chinese ethnic enclave of Jayang-4-dong in Gwangjin-gu, Seoul, South Korea. The study also investigates how the multilingual proficiency of Chinese students residing in this region impacts the linguistic landscape. The research findings reveal that areas predominantly populated by Chinese individuals not of Korean origin, especially college students, exhibit a significantly higher presence of Chinese in the linguistic landscape, characterized by bottom-up authorship. Additionally, the study highlights the manifestation of a \"layering\" pattern in top-down authorship, as discussed by Amos (2016), albeit less frequently. Concerning multilingualism, there is a prevalence of instances of replicating identical content. Furthermore, in contrast to Amos\"s findings (2016), this study indicates a relatively subdued presence of non-permanent varieties of materials, such as handwritten or home-printed items. This subdued presence can be attributed to the influence of virtual public spaces.",

        "abstract": "Ikuno Korea Town was a place where Koreans who came to Korea during the Japanese colonial era gathered and lived in poverty, and it was also a symbol of poverty and discrimination in Japanese society. From the 1950s to the 1970s, many Koreans in Japan visited this place to find food ingredients. However, since the 1970s, due to the generational change in Korean society in Japan, it has entered the path of decline. Afterwards, the store owners began to seek revitalization of Ikuno Korea Town through various methods such as landscape maintenance and holding festivals. And as of 2023, due to their efforts and the Korean Wave boom, Korean culture has been actively accepted, and Ikuno Cori Town is visited by so many visitors that there is no room to step foot. This paper paid attention to the signboards of the stores showing their names among the language landscapes of Ikuno Korea town with such a history. Since 1993, Ikuno Korea Town has enhanced its ethnic landscape with arcades, street lights, and road maintenance. However, when looking at the language landscape, it was confirmed that the stores that easily reveal the ethnicity of Ikuno Korea Town still use a lot of signboards written in Japanese. In most cases, store signboards are installed for the purpose of providing information about the store or urging customers to enter the store, and the language used in the store signboard is the choice of the store owner. In other words, store owners consider various social aspects when choosing a language for signboards, and store signboards reflect the culture of the society. Considering such points, using Japanese on signboards can be said to be one of the methods of Koreans in Japan store owners who tried to ‘coexist’ in Japanese society. Also, it was confirmed that Koreans in Japan tried to apply the cultures of their home country and the country of residence by crossing over through political and social conflicts in Japan.",

And the number of text characters in outdoor advertising materials was higher in the order of Hangul, Romanization, Mixed, Chinese character, and Japanese. Based on these results, we analyzed the linguistic landscape of Apsan Cafe Street. We found that lack of communicability was the highest in internal linguistic improvements while decline, aging, and aesthetic incongruity were the highest in external linguistic improvements.

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to analyze the linguistic landscape of urban fishing villages by collecting data on the language landscape of the urban fishing village formation period and further transforming the poor living base of the fishing village into a shape that can be restored. Accordingly, this study aims to collect data on the linguistic landscape during the formative period of urban and fishing villages, and to derive various social variables continuously. In addition, in order to achieve the aforementioned purpose of the study, the relationship between the current status of language life culture, the identity of the fishing village society, and the fishing villageness is examined through visual media (e.g., signboards of fishing village shops) that best represent the language culture in the fishing villageness. The purpose of this study is to recover the psychological and economic self-esteem of fishing villages in the future and to propose policies by securing basic humanistic data that can restore the fishing 'villageness'. In this study, the characteristics of fishing villages were inferred by using vocabulary, type of industry, frequency, etc. mainly used in fishing villages (East Sea, West Sea, South Sea, etc.) through Daum's road view. In addition, the actual trend of the language landscape of fishing villages made from the various writing systems and vocabulary included in the contents was analyzed. As for the survey site, the area adjacent to the beach designated in the early period (1971) among the national fishing ports of the Republic of Korea was investigated to see if the signboards around the fishing villages were concentrated with trade names and vocabularies directly related to maritime and fisheries. This study was to propose a sustainable fishing villageness in order to restore 'fishing villageness' and suggest a new approach to 'fishing villageness' that was actually derived, and to identify ways to effectively utilize it. In particular, it is meaningful to approach based on various social and cultural backgrounds from the linguistic point of view, which was rarely dealt with in previous research on fishing villageness. In raising the relevance of 'fishing villageness' derived through this study and the need for balanced development of fishing villages by region, there are implications in terms of confirming the establishment of 'fishing villageness' that can actively cope with revitalization of fishing villageness.",

Our aims are twofold as follows: (i) to consider how they are related to the catchphrases characterising the image of each area and (ii) to show how the linguistic landscape in each area reflects commonalities and differences in terms of usage aspects in each area and their areal features. As a result, we confirmed that the catchphrases in the five areas, Yufuin, Tsushima, Fukuoka, Busan, and Jeju ('住み良さ日本一の町、湯布院', 'おっ!な島です。対馬', 'アジアの玄関口、商人の町'、'福岡, 皆が幸せ東北アジアの海洋首都、釜山', and 'コミュニケーションで始まるハッピー濟州', respectively) are closely interrelated with the strategies of entrance language. More concretely, the following features were identified: (i) Yufuin and Tsushima, where people observe regulations, (ii) Jeju, which welcomes and attracts tourists, (iii) Busan and Yufuin, which are brimming with confidence, (iv) Jeju and Fukuoka, with the signs notifying that the visitors are not allowed to enter, and (v) Fukuoka and Jeju, where thankfulness matters.

        "abstract": "A ‘record’ of history can be found in language. For example, historical processes, such as colonialization, can be found in loanwords. In this paper, we analyze Japanese-origin loanwords (JOL) in Yapese, Chuukese, and Ponapean languages spoken by Pacific Island countries that fell in the hands of the Japanese Empire between the First and Second World Wars, and examine their usages in the linguistic landscape. In that sense, it could be argued that the influence of Japanese has been ‘recorded’ twice: first, as loanwords in the spoken language; second, when these words are used in the linguistic landscape. In addition, we examine the two cases of place names (or toponyms) and the ‘colonial lag’. The latter refers to the phenomenon whereby language undergoes changes in the ‘home country”, while leaving old forms in the former colonies. A case in point would the American English usage of mad for ‘angry’ when considering the United States as a former colony of England. Japanese colonial lag can be seen in word forms such as aisu keeki ‘popsicle’ which has disappeared from postwar Japanese speech, but it is still found in the languages of Palau and Saipan as well as Hawaiian English and even Korean.",

To explore the pedagogical potential of linguistic landscape, this study examines how pre-service teachers understand the concept and implications of linguistic landscape for English education. For this purpose, 35 South Korean pre-service elementary school teachers taking a multimedia English course attended a session about linguistic landscape and engaged in two activities using multimedia resources and online platforms: a virtual linguistic landscape task and a linguistic landscape fieldwork project. The analysis of the learning outcomes of these two activities revealed that linguistic landscapes helped pre-service teachers increase their language awareness of public language use. However, their engagement with language awareness was affected by the spaces they chose to collect public signs. In their reflections on the activities, the pre-service teachers indicated that linguistic landscapes could be valuable resources for authentic English and cultural learning. They also stated that the levels of linguistic difficulty and cultural contents of public signage should be controlled. This article concludes by discussing how linguistic landscape can contribute to improving English teachers’ critical language awareness.",

In this study, all websites of 845 local governments in Japan were surveyed, and the multilingual environment situation, the system of consideration for the socially disadvantaged, and the provision of information related to COVID-19 were examined. The results of this paper are as follows. First, the degree of multilingualization of Japanese local government websites has progressed very well. For example, when viewed on the average of prefectures, the homepage is implemented in more than five languages. Beyond the four languages (Japanese, English, Chinese, and Korean), which are standard models of the linguistic landscape, it can be seen that various languages are flexibly provided according to the characteristics of each prefecture. Second, as a device for easy-to-understand information delivery, SNS communication channels and consideration devices for the weak are also provided on the local government's website. SNS communication channels are also operating close to two or more channels on average. Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram were the highest in order. Unlike Korea, information sharing is continuously carried out using LINE, which is strong in Japan. Third, convenience for the physically handicapped on its website is provided by many local governments. Finally, it was also possible to check whether information related to COVID-19 was provided in the pandemic situation.",

        "abstract": "This thesis proposes and develops the framework of ‘trans-scription’ to argue for the need to differentiate between scripts and languages in the sociolinguistic analysis of public signs and meaning in landscapes. Starting with examples from both professional literature and folk linguistics, the paper illustrates the routine ways in which script and language are conflated in the interpretation of public signage. This ‘isomorphic account’ provides limited insights into the way scripts operate across landscapes, and results in simplistic interpretations of the language practice at work.As an alternative, this thesis draws on the tenets of translingualism, including the emphasis on blurred structural boundaries and notions of resources and repertoires, to propose a view of script as an independent semiotic resource with linguistic potential, which can be variously linked with, and delinked from, language. Taking the city of Seoul as a case study, and paying particular attention to the Korean script, Hangul, the paper shows how the isomorphic account, itself a product of Western, alphabet-focused interpretations of language and script, fails to capture the linguistic and semiotic complexity present in the urban landscapes of this East Asian metropolis. Through the analysis of representative samples from a corpus of 1931 signs, collected in the historical districts of Jongno and Yongsan, the alternative ‘trans-scription’ account illustrates how the assumption that language is script, and vice versa, obscures the ways in which script can be used independently and in concert with language to produce space, circumscribe populations, and design localities.Their functional invisibility, meanwhile, makes scripts a powerful tool for guiding social meaning-making and interpretation, and for influencing spatiotemporal and ideological positioning, which justifies the proposed expansion of the Herderian nation-state Triad of ‘one people, one land, one language’, to a Tetrad which includes scripts, as well. The need for this extended account is further evidenced through an analysis of the covert and overt policies promoted by the Korean government. These policies not only perpetuate an ideologically homogenous, uniform account of language through the localization of public spaces, but also simultaneously capitalize on the diversity of trans-scription practices present in the landscape. This contrast between practice and policy is mirrored by the government goal of simultaneously ‘preserving’ and ‘developing’ Hangul in public landscapes and beyond, which can be feasibly achieved by guiding and delimiting local forms of trans-scription while simultaneously monitoring and regulating the influx of global resources into the country. I theorize these instances of governmental oversight and incursion into public spaces as a form of ‘neoliberal governmentality’, since their implicit goal, in addition to maintaining the structure of the nation-state, is the expansion of markets and the economic development of the country. At the intersection of these dual interests, script serves as a vehicle for materializing the otherwise abstract and porous boundaries of language, and subsequently reifying the language affiliated national identities and spaces.The analysis of landscapes through the framework of trans-scription yields a set of narrow and broad implications for a wide range of language and society related disciplines. The narrow set of implications constitutes an alternative account of language and script practices and policies in the context of Seoul, and South Korea in general, which challenges the dominant and widespread ideologies of a homogenous and uniform Korean language/script/nation/territory. The broad set of implications addresses the sociolinguistic oversight of the relative differences between the ‘semiotic’ and ‘linguistic’ categories in space, using the findings in Seoul to show how much more nuanced and complex landscape analysis becomes once these differences are attended to. The thesis concludes with a few remarks regarding the need for contemporary linguistic frameworks, and particularly translingualism, to be more attentive to the relationship between what is ‘semiotic’ and what is ‘linguistic’ in interaction and practice, and how these categories shift across spatiotemoporal, sociocultural, and individual frames of reference.",

Qualitative and quantitative analyses of JFL learners class journals indicate that linguistic landscapes are effective in raising awareness in the following areas. - the sociological phenomenon of the use of Japanese and multiple languages - the use of linguistic landscape as a method to experience foreign (Japanese) culture - the application of linguistic landscape as a learning resource to facilitate pro-active self-learning 3. When the concept of linguistic landscape was introduced to intermediate and advanced learners of Japanese in the JSL environment, it was found that the surveys facilitate active learning.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on how changes in social conditions and values, such as the difficulties in face-to-face retail selling as a result of the covid pandemic, and the boycott of Japanese products under the \"NO JAPAN\" slogan, are reflected in language landscapes. In specific, our purpose is to examine the linguistic landscapes of shopping streets in Korea frequented by young people, from the perspective of the degree of \"diversity\" and the intensity of people’s feelings of intractability, in an effort to shine light on phenomena of changes and maintenance in Japanese usage. The results of our analyses may be summed up as follows. 1. In unique linguistic landscapes such as signs incorporating Japanese place names and regional specialties, those that utilize Japanese sentence structures, and those that use Japanese-style shop names and trademark logos, we find a great diversity in the use of kanji, hiragana, katakana, romaji, and hangul, revealing a strong particularity of attitudes. In particular, we find that attempts to produce a Japanese aura, as well as the use of imagery through store names and trademark logos play a strong symbolic role similar to that of pictograms. 2. With signs promoting a shop’s longevity such as “since 20xx”, and signs containing words targeted for eradication in the language purification movement, we find little diversity, but the former serve a practical purpose and the use of the latter in shop names reveals the strength of a desire to create a sense of authentic Japanese-ness. 3. Compared with the pre-covid era, we find a strong tendency towards signs that blindly and unquestioningly sought to purge hiragana on the one hand, and those which flexibly made use of Romanization or resourcefully disguised Japanese words as Korean by writing them in hangul (quasi-Korean signs). These opposing trends of “flexible resourcefulness” and “blindly following the crowd” demonstrate that change and maintenance of Japanese linguistic landscapes reflect its ability to interpret the zeitgeist and go with the flow. In conjunction with psychological and sociological factors, we conclude that from an economic standpoint, the use of Japanese is no longer useful in increasing sales.",

To accomplish this purpose, this study tries to extract conceptual elements of the linguistic landscape by documentary research, and tries to construct contents elements of Korean language education considering a relation of Korean education by curriculum research. As a result, two ways for Korean subject curriculum application of the linguistic landscape are established, “Linguistic landscape in Korean language educational use” and “Linguistic landscape as Korean language educational contents”. And as the contents category of the linguistic landscape as Korean language educational contents, “Multimodality of the linguistic landscape” and “Validity of the linguistic landscape” are set up, and concrete contents elements in each category are suggested. This study has a meaning to design the practical educational contents through the linguistic landscape in an era of diversity of language modes and language culture.",

        "abstract": "This study has recognized the patterns of errors in Korean notation that is seen in various areas within Japan and has analyzed the errors to find the following outcomes. Errors in notation: These errors were related to mis-spelling or wrong spacing in Korean notation. Examples of errors in notation include “ベビーベッド” being translated into “귀저기 갈이용 탁자” and “屋上展望台” being translated into “옥상잔망대” while errors in spacing were seen in “この先、通り抜けできません” being translated into “당신은 통과 할 수 없습니다” and “許可車両以外進入禁止” being translated into “관계자외 침입금지”. Errors in vocabulary: These errors were related to the use of Korean words that were either misused or not used in Korea. Examples of errors in vocabulary include “許可車両以外進入禁止” being translated into “관계자외 침입금지”, “ベビーカー貸し出し” being translated into “유모차대출”, “ドッグラン” “ドッグ カフェ” being translated into “개 난” “개 카페”. Errors in grammar: Grammatical errors in Korean notation include “같은 마크라도 사용할 수 없을 경우가 있습니다” and “使用済み注射器·針” being translated into “사용 후 주사기·바늘”. Errors in expression: Despite no error in grammar, these errors have used awkward expressions that are not often used in Korea. Examples include “앉으면서 이용하세요” and “길거리에서 불이 붙은 담배를 가지고 걷지 말 것”. Wrong translation: These errors were caused by wrong translation from Japanese to Korean. Examples include “鴨そば” being translated into “오리 옆”, “牛バラ石焼ビビンバ” being translated into “소 장미 돌 솥 비빔밥”, and “枡形山広場と展望台” being translated into “합니다분이산광장전망대”. In addition, there were also cases of discord between the original Japanese word and the Korean notation. Examples of these include errors in Korean notation as seen in “大山” written as “오오야마”, “丹 沢山” written as “탄자와야마”, and “富士山” written as “후지산”. Examples of missing words in the Korean notation are seen in “医療廃棄物(使用済み注射器·針等)は必ずお持ち帰りになり、正規の方法での処 分をお願い致します” written as “의료 폐기물(사용 후 주사기·바늘 등)은 다시 가져가시고 적절한 방법으로 취급을” and “棚へのよりかかりは危険ですのでおやめください” written as “난간에 기대 위험하오니 삼가 주십시오”. Examples of differences in the Korean notation of the same Japanese word were noticed in “飲 み残し” written as “마셔 남기” “마셔남겨” and “駐輪場” written as “주륜장” “경륜장” respectively.",

As it reflects the population composition and the socio-cultural status among language groups in the society, the linguistic landscape of Seoul has been dominated by Korean and English in most places. However, other languages, such as Chinese, also appears in certain parts of the city, where the foreign population is concentrated, and their proportions are increasing in recent years. In this work, we examine the levels of segregation between the Chinese language and other languages in Seoul\"s linguistic landscape. Over 10 thousand street-level images were collected and analyzed, and it was found that the levels of the linguistic isolation have decreased over the years between 2008 and 2018. This result implies that the overall degree of segregation between Chinese and non-Chinese people has also moderated, not only in residential neighborhoods but also in their daily activity spaces.",

Secondly, whilst Korean speakers prefer the “presentation of personal information” and the “future promise” strategy, Japanese speakers prefer the strategy that delivers a message of refusal in terms of “notification” and “appreciation.” Thirdly, in the context of refusal in entrance linguistic landscapes, several types of means such as “minimalisation of strategies,” the use of “impossible” strategy, and simplification of forms are used in order to prevent miscommunication between communicators and their recipients.

Results of analyzing the linguistic landscape signals of Tsushima, Yufu, and Fukuoka are as follows. Firstly, the types of issues concerning the over-tourism are Trash disposal issue, Manners for using toilets, No take-out food, No smoking, No photographs, No entry, No parking, CCTV in operation, No damage to cultural properties, Manners for using facilities, No noise, and No shoplifting, etc. Secondly, in case of Tsushima, the trash disposal issue was most serious. It appears that most linguistic landscapes signals in Tsushima included signals written in Korean. Suggested by this fact, it seemed that the majority of tourists in Tsushima was Korean. On the other hand, in Yufu and Fukuoka, most frequent linguistic landscape signal types were No smoking, No take-out food, and Manners of using toilets. Thirdly, in Japanese expressions used in the over-tourism linguistic landscape signals, many forms of prohibition, command, and punishment were found. The translated Korean expressions were often rough translation of the Japanese expressions. Some translated Korean linguistic landscapes signals contained many expressions that raised a doubt or an embarrassment about sender\"s intent from the perspective of Korean tourists. Fourthly, in the general over-tourism, the linguistic landscapes signals exhibit messages of direct and strong caution, prohibition, and warning, which may offend tourists. Therefore, the current study offered the necessity of linguistic landscape signals written in grateful form, apology form, and euphemistic prohibition expression, etc. in consideration of tourists who are message recipients",

This study investigated the status and behavior of road signs in marine tourism cities, and examined the trends and patterns of multilingual notation. To this end, 280 road sign users in Busan and Yokohama were empirically verified through structural equation modeling (SEM) on the effect of aesthetics and presence on information usefulness and user satisfaction from a personal characteristic perspective. As a result of the analysis, it was found that both Busan and Yokohama users had a significant positive effect on information usefulness, and information usefulness had a significant positive effect on the relationship between user satisfaction. In particular, it was found that presence had a relatively higher effect than aesthetics. The results of this study not only provide cognitive mechanisms for practitioners to design and apply linguistic landscapes (road signs), but can also be used as a criterion for determining whether linguistic landscapes (road signs) have been effectively implemented. In addition, with a new approach, it will contribute to the management plan of the linguistic landscape that can be actually used for the establishment and operation of strategies in tourist cities through the mechanism of road signs.",

        "abstract": "Great emphasis is placed on proper noun translation because those associated with tourist attractions must provide tourist information as clear as possible. However, if proper nouns are translated by following the current foreign language notation rules of the National Institute of Korean Language, the original Chinese pronunciation will be over-emphasized, as a result, the meaning of Chinese characters cannot be properly conveyed to the tourists who do not know Chinese. The study discussed Korean translation, focusing on the proper nouns related to tourism in Hangzhou, China, chiefly on the names of natural landscapes, historic sites, causeways, islands, roads, and names of restaurants and dishes. This paper brings forward an ideal approach to do the translation based on a questionnaire survey conducted among Chinese and Korean philologists. According to the investigation, both Koreans and Chinese prefer Korean-style Chinese characters on a notice board or a menu. However, the proportion of Korean respondents preferring the original Chinese notation in accordance with the rules of the National Institute of Korean Language is relatively higher than that of Chinese respondents. As to some Chinese names such as Xiaohe Hill, Qiantang River, Xixi Wetland, Waipojia Restaurant, many Korean respondents choose the original Chinesephonetic notation, while many Chinese respondents use the Korean Chinese phonetic translation method. In conclusion, the translation of proper nouns should be flexible in light of specific circumstances and types rather than following one uniform rule or strategy. The translation of proper nouns requires comprehensive consideration of the aspects such as effectiveness of information transfer, habituation, consistency, communication, and visual effects. The names of natural landscapes, relic sites, causeways, islands, and roads should be translated with Korean Chinese characters notation, and the names of the food with original notation+interpretation.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to report the first ever attempt to develop learning materials (video/reading materials) for a “course focusing on linguistic landscapes”, and discuss outcomes of the implementation of these materials in the course. The course was conducted as a specialized subject, enrolled by a multicultural group of students mainly belonging to an international faculty referred to as “Intercultural Communication”. A total of 132 students enrolled in the course (of which 21 were international students). Prior to learning, a “survey of linguistic landscapes”, that was based on a 5-point evaluation scale and a free description, was conducted to observe the students’ awareness of linguistic landscapes. The 5-point evaluation scale showed an average figure of 2.46 and comments obtained through the free description survey were superficial. Therefore, it was evident that the students’ overall awareness of linguistic landscapes was low. A total of 15 classes were held, with each having a specific theme according to the prepared video or reading material. The classes began with less difficult themes and gradually progressed to those more complex. The first seven classes were straightforward, introducing linguistic landscapes with obvious features. Subsequent themes discussed the importance of knowledge about countries, regions, or societies, observational skills of cultural backgrounds and linguistic awareness of people, and pragmatic analysis. The consistent learning contents and goals in all the themes was “to enroll in a Japanese course (which is the target language for international students), acquire diverse perspectives and thinking abilities, and gain discussion and presentation skills while also learn what can be understood through Japanese linguistic landscapes in daily life.” After completion of the course, a final term repot was assigned to assess the students’ achievement level. More than half of the students had written reports on difficult themes, indicating their increase in awareness of linguistic landscapes and they had learned “how to observe and analyze linguistic landscapes”, which also supported the effectiveness of this course.",

        "abstract": "In the latter half of the 1990s, the opening of Japanese popular culture allowed free acceptance of Japanese movies and songs in Korea. Travel to Japan has increased, and since the 2000s, Japanese culture has become familiar. This social situation also affects the Korean language landscape. In other words, Japanese store names are becoming more visible. In this paper, I studied the naming method for Japanese restaurants around the university. This is because I think that foreign cultures are accepted more quickly around the university than in other places, and that the naming method will give rise to ideas and features that can appeal to young people. As a result of investigating Japanese restaurants in three universities, Japanese was most often used in naming the stores. Next is a mixture of Japanese and Korean. In addition, approximately 24 of the 47 locations use sub-store names, but if the main store name is in Japanese, the main store name and the sub-store name have a symmetrical relationship such as Hangul vs. Kana or Kanji. This is for clear display and communication of the main store name of Japanese. Restaurants in other countries, especially the recently popular Chinese \"MARATANG\" related restaurants, use the Chinese word \"麻辣(MARA)\" as it is, but this shows a tendency different from Japanese related restaurants. In addition, there are also naming methods only around the university, such as \"엄마밥줘,\" which appeals to my mother\"s affection. In the future, we would like to expand the survey area and the target areas to investigate the characteristics of the language landscape using Japanese depending on the area or target (young people of university vs. office workers in the downtown).",

In addition, studies that serve as a guide to the direction of language landscape research are poor. Therefore, this paper introduced the case of language landscape from the perspective of historical socio?linguistics. And based on the research that has been conducted so far, we have classified the new language landscape paradigm. It can be arranged as follows. From a historical socio-linguistics standpoint, I looked at the language landscape of Busan and Busan after liberation of Japanese colonial era. As a result, there was an diversity in language, text, content, and character arrangement. One photo shows the lives of ordinary people living in Japanese colonial era. Based on this, it is possible to study the language landscape. Next, existing language landscape studies were categorized into new paradigms. It was organized using concepts that emerged during language landscape research, such as the sender, the sending scene, context, language consciousness, method of survey, image, education, multi?cultural society, etc. In addition, there are more paradigms of language landscape.

        "abstract": "This study surveys and analyzes the linguistic landscapes of Korean in Tsushima Island. Surveys were conducted twice between 2017 and 2019, before ‘NO-Japan movement’ in Korea spread nationwide. A common key feature of the two surveys is ‘the Korean Language Specialization’ ; that is, the use of the Korean language alone, or a combination of Korean-Japanese, or Korean-Japanese-English has been constant on signboards in the streets where tourists’ shops are densely concentrated. In the survey of 2019, Romanized Korean signboards such as ‘TOKISEKI’ or ‘DAEMADO’ were sighted, which may implicitly consider Japanese residents in Tsushima. Another characteristic feature is an influence from ‘over-tourism’ due to the soaring number of Korean tourists to the island. Whereas more direct and stronger prohibition, warning signs are frequently collected in 2017, the tone of prohibition is weakened and more indirect expressions are observed in 2019. In addition, the Korean community established during the survey of 2017 has obviously become more organized and stabilized in 2019. This can be certainly verified from several facts: (1) another Korean Residents Union in Japan is inaugurated in order to protect Korean tourists’ legal rights and safety, (2) Korean linguistic landscape is expanded from the areas highly populated b tourists to less densely populated tourist spots, (3) the Korean community conveys prohibition messages in Japanese to the local Japanese residents. These facts from the linguistic landscapes clearly show that Koreans in Tsushima Island have firmly established the full membership in the local community.<br />This study surveys and analyzes the linguistic landscapes of Korean in Tsushima Island.

        "abstract": "This study is conducted to discuss and analyze language contact phenomena focusing on the linguistic landscape of regions in Korea and Japan, that lie close to each other. The main findings are as follows: 1. Korean origin loanwords used in Japan and Japanese origin loanwords used in Korea share a common characteristic that most these words are related to food · dietary life. Korean origin loanwords used in Japan have an additional note in Katakana written above the corresponding Korean words while Japanese origin loanwords used in Korea are written next to Korean words. 2. The study has clarified the spread of the Korean dialect type. Both 지짐[tsidzim] and 저래기[tsʌrɛgi] are dialects originating from Kyeongbuk Privince in Korea, and are being used as Korean origin loanwords as a result of language transfer and contact in Japan. The usage of these words is not limited to Japan but have also expanded to Jeilongjjang Province in China and Pyeongan Province in North Korea. Such a phenomenon clearly shows the signs of linguistic expansion in which words travel across borders and spread to neighboring countries. 3. The use of Japanese origin loanwords used in Korea are prominently those that underwent the secondary derivation, such as 쟉크[tsak̕u] and 추리닝[tsʰuriniɲ]. The secondary loanwords such as 테이크아웃 ‘take out’ are continued to be used in present days. 4. The use of loanwords related to ‘food · dietary life’ is found in all types of the language contact phenomenon according to the report on current usage of loanwords categorized by their meanings. Also, the result displayed that ‘words related to humans’ are the most used among ‘concept nouns’ and loanwords in ‘daily supplies’ are limited to those that underwent the secondary derivation. Both findings evidently support the result of preceding studies. Overall, the result confirmed that Hangeul-Japanese words (Japanese words written in Hangeul) are used in various forms within their semantic category. These findings clarify that the usage of these loanwords is concentrated on those closely related to daily life.",

As increasing numbers of international students change the campus into a more multilingual space, a variety of multilingual signs posted on bulletin boards and streets on campus become commonplace. Against such a backdrop of sociolinguistic changes on the globalizing campus in higher education, this study explores the ways in which multiple languages are chosen and used in South Korean higher education. Drawing on the framework of linguistic landscape, the present project analyzes multilingual signs displayed in public spaces of Konkuk University Glocal Campus, a local university that has pursued internationalization policies over the past decade. For this purpose, 208 public signs were collected from thirteen locations and analyzed in terms of language, producers, and communicative functions. The analysis reveals that a typical multilingual sign is in English and Korean and is created by the university authorities for referential functions. The most multilingual spaces are the library, a building for international education, and the dormitory, as these locations display various languages and language combinations. English is the most dominant foreign language in multilingual signage. Chinese and Vietnamese signs have begun to be increasingly present at KU, but their communicative functions are relatively limited. Based on such findings, implications for the university’s language and internationalization policies are also discussed.",

The language resources that represent the plurilinguistic characteristics of Korean society are called “translanguage.” This study analyzed various kinds of languages such as TV programs, face-to-face conversations, SNS content, and street guides. The framework established in this study for the analysis of the transversal language landscape in Korea is constituted by two factors: “background of language users” and “contact zone.” “Background of language users” comprises L1,” “age,” and “communication purpose,” while “contact zone” comprises “SNS content,” “street,” and “advertisements.” Based on the analyzing, some suggestions were provided for teaching Korean and Korean culture.",

Above all, this study reviewed Wongok-dong which was reproduced by movies and documentaries in the tourist gaze. When the target district was examined from the tourist gaze, five different characteristics were found: First, an exotic landscape has been formed thanks to promotional materials and sign boards in multiple languages. Second, a lot of cellphone stores, currency exchange shops, travel agencies, noraebang (Korean karaoke rooms) and beauty salons are lined along the streets. Third, a gate to Wongok-dong is deemed unnecessary. Fourth, the streets are very dirty and littered. Lastly, many people are looking for a job. As discussed in the films and documentaries, Wongok-dong has formed a multicultural landscape and showed many problems. To get over such issues, acceptance, tolerance and equality instead of discrimination and exclusion should be established. For this, this study proposes that it is needed to overcome the absence of trust and a lack of communications between natives and foreigners and between the government and residents. Furthermore, it suggests that it should be improved as a foreign tourist specialized area.",

        "abstract": "South Korean universities have undergone a significant transformation into culturally and ethnically diverse spaces due to the increasing influx of international students, driven by institutional efforts toward internationalization in higher education. This paper examines the impacts of this sociocultural change on the sociolinguistic environments within internationalizing universities, with a specific focus on the role of multilingualism in shaping linguistic landscape. In this study, four universities with distinct types and internationalization policies were selected. Through multiple fieldwork, documents regarding the demographics of international students and language policies, and multilingual signage in and out of campus were collected. The analysis reveals that, regardless of the university types, English signage emerged as the dominant linguistic landscape. Multilingual signs were identified, but they often exhibited low material quality and were strategically placed in specific locations. The prevailing multilingual signage primarily served top-down, informative, and directive functions. A limited number of bottom-up, expressive, and translingual signs were only observed in areas where everyday multiculturalism was allowed and experienced. This study suggests that the mere increase in cultural and ethnic diversity within these institutions does not automatically result in linguistic diversity. In conclusion, this paper underscores the need for deliberate efforts to enhance linguistic diversity within internationalizing South Korean universities.",

In multilingual signs, Hangul and English are most often used together. There is a code preference between Hangul and English. When English is a dominant language, Hangul is less visible and mainly offers transliteration. When Korean is a dominant language, English mainly offers information.

Linguistic landscape is the visibility and salience of languages on public and commercial signs in a given territory or region (Landry and Bourhis, 1997, p.23), and it is a fast evolving research area. However, few studies are found in Korean language education. By illustrating how the concept of LL is applied to Korean as a second language context, this study fills this gap. This study is grounded on how the concept of regional competence (Watson et al. 2013) is relevant to a holistic view of linguistic landscape that is applied in the students’ analysis of different signs in Korea. 11 learners in a study abroad program in Korea participated in this project, and they investigated the complexity of the linguistic environment and multilingualism in Korea while they were in the study abroad program. Then they shared their pictures and analyses on Facebook as a platform for prompt exchanges of ideas. Focusing on the issues of translation, audience and context, and language selection, we analyze 1) students’ final presentation, 2) interaction in Facebook, and 3) reflection papers for this study.

But, in case of ‘Korean Chinese Japan’, ‘Course’ was 13.7 and ‘Alleyway’ was 16.7%. ‘Alleyway’ showed slightly higher rate, but there were no significant differences between them. The totals of multi-language marking were Course (49.1%) and Alleyway (42.4%), and there was no uniformity in the language framework. Guide boards or signs of these two courses were marked in multi-languages, however the biggest problem was that only ‘Korean’ was written in the notices of museums or descriptive texts of exhibits.",

In doing so, the Greater Anyang Region, located south of Seoul, was selected as the site for the current study. This area is comprised of three cities (Anyang, Gunpo, Uiwang) with a number of business districts including the old downtown and new centers of each city, creating a clear difference in landscape between each area. The study observed the linguistic landscape around subway stations in this region. By observing the rate of English use on commercial signs in these commercial districts, it was found that there is a parallel line between the size of a floating population and the percentage of English in the public sphere. In addition, different rates of English use in different areas reflect a decline of old downtowns, while showing the higher economic status of newer commercial districts. Such phenomena provide an instance of a close relationship between the use of English and a floating population, since the busier business districts appear to have more use of English.",

This study focuses on how historical and social background has been reflected in building the current regional features of Quebec. Firstly the present paper examines the historical background in Quebec which is centred on French language and culture. It then investigates current institutional plans enacted by the Quebec government in relation to language and culture, and also looks at cultural landscapes encompassing French tradition in two major cities in Quebec―Quebec City and Montreal. The study finally discusses implications of preserving language and cultural identity in the region of Quebec. This research shows that the consistent endeavors of Quebec to keep their national identity on the basis of policies of regionalism could be seen as sociopolitical phenomena by their own choices to survive against the inequality and hegemony of globalization, even though this may cause tensions and resistance against non-Quebecois as well as social and economic losses in Quebec. The province of Quebec appears to position itself well by making good use of its regional features originating from its historical background and by flexibly integrating globalization and regionalism.",

Facilitated by the increased flow of (Korean) foreigners, linguistic landscape in Korea has become heterogeneous. It can be well understood in terms of metrolingualism, which explains everyday language practice in diverse urban spaces. For example, it includes the mixture of various languages, ethnic groups, and nationalities. In this study, TV advertisement, broadcast, and newspaper articles from the Korean mass media were collected and placed in the five domains of metrolinguistic landscape in Korea: everyday practice, playfulness, layered identities, relocalization, and multitasking. It was found that everyday translingual practice often appeared in the Korean media. Playfulness through code-switching was taken as fashion. Fluxity and fuilidity of languages and identities were intersected, where metrolinguals crossed the borders among different languages as they insisted upon the conventional membership by speaking the language of their target community. Metrolingualism was also well explained in relocalization of cuisine, in the lyrics of hip-hop, or in the multitasking of all linguistic features as resources. It can be argued that language is emergent from the local urban practice, where social interaction arises with spatial interaction. Metrolingualism is expected to describe how different languages, or language with varieties, are adopted to communicate, and predict the upcoming linguistic societies in Korea.",

        "abstract": "Language policy approach to linguistic landscape: Focused on issues of multilingualism policy Cho, TaeRin (Daegu Univ.) The objective of this research is to review achievements and limitations of linguistic landscape studies in Korea in the wake of taking fundamental issue about the concept of linguistic landscape, finally in order to reveal that linguistic landscape is an important problem of language policy, specially multilingual policy. With the purpose of achieving this objective, this research find firstly four characteristics which the concept of linguistic landscape includes. (1) Linguistic landscape presupposes public space but includes both public signs and private signs. (2) Linguistic landscape appears firstly in the visual form as letter, etc. (3) Linguistic landscape is worthy of notice in the urban area than rural area, specially in the commercial area in the city. (4) Linguistic landscape reflects attitudes and use aspects of dwellers in relevant area about multilingualism. On the basis of conceptual discussion as above, linguistic landscape in a narrow sense is defined as “visual landscape which is formed by one or more language using in both public signs and private signs in the public space of particular area, specially in urban area”. However, if this concept is extended, linguistic landscape can not only include rural area but also soundscape or tactual landscape. And then, a review of linguistic landscape studies in Korea reveals that linguistic landscape studies departed by geographical approach have developed into linguistic approach and aesthetic approach. However, many of these studies exposed the common limitations in the sense that they lean too much towards normative or nationalistic viewpoint and that their research objects are too concentrated in specific signs like signboard which are convenient for access and statistic analysis. Fianlly, this research proposes that linguistic landscape study expands it's range to the issues of multilingualism such as linguistic human right of linguistic minority besides the issues of beautiful and correct use of Korean language and Hangeul.

The column reflected the thoughts on the language of Han Changki, who established the periodical. Composed of a snapshot and a short description, it not only offers us the landscapes around the signs on the streets of the 1970s in Korea but evokes issues to consider about the relationship between the society of the time and its language policy and language. In this study, the concept of ‘linguistic landscape’ is applied to investigate the linguistic environment suggested in ‹Bol manhan kkolbulgyun› and infer its typographic implication. In conclusion, the characteristics of the typography that was used in public places in the 1970s are the use of Korean mixed with Chinese letters on signs, plagiarism in branding and naming, and the use of the Roman alphabet as an image. This shows that the typography in the public sphere was the result of the relationship between the language and the society, and it was also the site of competition for meaning where the policy from above and the everyday desire from below were concretized. In conclusion, this study recognized that it was the parts of public typographic characteristics of the 1970s that the use of Korean mixed with Chinese letters on signs, plagiarism in branding and naming, and the use of the Roman alphabet as an image used in public places in that time. This shows that the typography in the public sphere was the ideological result of the relationship between the language and the society and it was also a process to figure out that it was the site of competition for meaning where the policy from above and the everyday desire from below were condensed.",

        "abstract": "This study attempts to compare and contrast the linguistic landscape expressed through campaign posters in subway trains in Seoul and Tokyo. The results are summarized as follows: 1. Messages of the linguistic landscape expressed through public campaign posters in South Korea and Japan are listed first, after which they are compared and contrasted from a sociolinguistic point of view. The analysis revealed specific distinguishing messages that are only found in Korea. One distinguishable message conveyed in subway trains in Seoul is the ‘Walking on the Right’ campaign. In Korea, right-walking has recently started after a tradition of left?walking that lasted over 90 years, which started during the Japanese colonial period. Other characteristic campaigns are ‘Seats for Pre-Mom (pregnant woman)’, ‘No purchasing from Hawkers or No Free?Riding! In Japan, on the other hand, there are several messages appealing to passengers not to use mobile phones or electronic devices near the ‘Priority Seats’ (for those with weak hearts), which are provided for those who are wearing pacemakers after having had heart surgery: ‘Please turn off your mobile phone near the Priority Seats.’ Other characteristic campaign messages are: ‘Hold your backpack in front of you,’ which follows the recent fashion and convenience fad, or ‘Please refrain from putting on make-up in the train,’ etc. 2. A recent trend of the linguistic landscape is multilingualism. This research also attempts a comparative and contrastive analysis in order to examine; (1) whether public advertisements in subway trains reflect this trend, and, (2) if reflected, according to which types of multilingualism the messages could be classified, based on the classifications of Souji (2009) and Backhaus (2011): ‘Westernization’, ‘Internationalization’, ‘Multi- ethnicitization’, and ‘Asianization’. As a consequence, Japan seems to be at the stage of ‘Internationalization’ with the highest ratio of cases, i.e., 49.5% (51 cases out of 103), in which both Japanese and English are used in public campaigns. In Korea, in contrast, the linguistic landscape of ‘Internationalization’ is only found in 4 cases out of 107 (3.7%), while Korean is the only language used on 93.1% (95 out of 102 cases) of campaign posters, thereby prominently showing a phenomenon of uni-lingualism.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this research is to examine the cultural hybridization of language activities and their dynamics in a sea-port city by studying the signboard notations in the city of Incheon. For this study, we comparatively analyzed the signboard notations in four different sections of the city (the tourist spots, University Street, the New Town, and the Old Town,) as we examined the characteristics of the cultural hybridization and dynamics. In the first stage of analysis, we examined the orientation of the notations in the signboards in different districts of the target city, by studying the main language used for notations in signboard and the existence of concurrent notations in the same signboards. First, the result of our survey showed that majority of the signboards in the tourist spots was Korean, followed by Western language words, mixed use words, Chinese character words, special words, and Japanese language words. Second, the language orientation in the University Street was dominated by Korean and Western language words. Thirdly, the language orientation in the new town area was centered on Korean and Western language words. Fourth, the language orientation in the old town was dominated by Korean words. In the next stage of our analysis, we conducted statistical analyses in order to confirm the characteristics of the language used in signboard notations in each of these districts (networkability). The result of our analysis showed that the tourist spots, where the traffic of foreign tourists is significant, had a significantly higher proportion of Chinese character words. It signifies that the hybridity and openness, that is, the dense network in the tourist spots in Incheon created Chinese character words for the signboard notations with a dynamic tendency. Second, the languages used on the signboards of the University Street did not show any preference to a specific language. However, it was also noteworthy that the absolute number of signboards using Chinese character words and Western language words decreased in this district. Thirdly, the language used in the signboards of the New Town showed a higher preference to Western language words compared to other districts. Fourth, the signboard languages in the Old Town was relatively more Korean-oriented compared to other districts, while the number of signboards using Western language words was smaller than those in other districts.",

Of course country or locational difference is existed, but the case of public post or sign in Korea and Japan that has formed as it stop without any adding language, if these are reached a certain standard. The second model has formed that is changing to user centered from supplier centered. you can see this pattern in tourist spot or wrapper of global food companies. The third model has formed that is possible to be added to new language continuously, as time passes. This model is applicable in emergency situation or disaster situation. The last model is a future?oriented patterns. This patterns are reverse pattern that the language is decreasing, but not increasing, any more. We can see this in new opening subway or new buildings are designed to new sensation.

Linguistic landscape consisting of usually the visual effects is given its value by the special features of language. Namely the language landscapes mean the language activities through a character or the results of such language activities carried out in the shared space. These language landscapes are classified the language landscapes and dialect landscapes according to the type of the expression language.

The result of analysis showed that languages used on signboardsin Busan had similarities and differences at the same time. Firstly, the similarities they had could be found in shopnames. That is, in all of the 4 areas, shop names appeared in most cases. The differences included that theappearance rate of business descriptions was around 30%, which was rather low, in areas with strong networks andcharacterized by hybridity and diversity. On the other hand, areas with weaker networks (Residential area 1 and 2)showed higher appearance rates of 60 to 70%, which was twice as high. In the second stage, the languagedistribution in signboard language was analyzed, by analyzing the language used in shop names, which had ahigher appearance rate. The result showed that the language type in signboards in the 4 areas mainly focused onthe Western language words and Chinese-Korean words.

The analysis of this category was applicable on semiotic meaning. The research results are as follows: First, the main part of the business category was food. 56.3% of Ganguri and 61.8% of Opori had the name of food businesses. Second, the semiotic characteristics of Gang-Gu harbor streets mainly mean place name or friendly name. The food business could be related to the principal products of this district which are called Young-Duk Great Crab. Also, the place name could be from symbolic meaning of the crab and the friendly name could be connected with increasing the sales. Finally, the semiotic approach to landscape does not fully cover the streetscape but could be useful for understanding a skeleton of harbor streetscape.",

It is also necessary to understand them from a multi-layered perspective because the sign boards of Japanese-Korean shops and their streets in Ikuno ward consist of multiple languages, symbols, colors, pictures, and so on.

The results of the study can be summarized as follows: First, the element of a physical environment that develops a sense of place was in fact the poor dwellings that correspond to the economic condition of Korean Chinese. While this element has a negative cognition to outsiders, Korean Chinese feel positively toward it. Secondly, signboards were a physical element of sense of place which retains cultural identity as a means of communication inside the community. Thirdly, it was found that activities such as shopping, recreation, and the exchange of information that are found in the pursuit of daily life act as an essential element in the formation of a sense of place even more than architectural elements. Fourthly, the appropriation of space by Korean Chinese and the isolation from the surroundings were obvious. This isolation is perceived as a negative sense of place formation to outsiders in Yen-Ben Street. Fifthly, the aspects of cultural dualism, mingling the concepts of home country, language, writing, and food have also affected the formation of a sense of place in the area. Sixthly, transience was a prominent phenomenon of Yen-Ben Street, and is strengthened by illegal immigration. Although transience causes negative impacts such as in a lack of concern for the residential environment, it acts as a positive factor in the sense of place by mitigating uneasiness, and strengthening insider ties and cooperation.",

        "abstract": "In general, every city shows a specific cultural landscape according to the cultural inheritance of its city-dwellers. The author attempted to find out an aspect of city-culture through the trade-names of various kinds of shops displayed on sign boards along the streets of major retail areas. The over all linguistic landscape of Korea has been changed several times since the beginning of the present century. Prior to the Japanese occupation of Korea in 1910, Chinese characters were widely used, especially among high societies as well as trade-names. During the occupation, however, the Korean language was forbidden, and Japanese prevailed in every aspect of Korean society. Frequent contact with Western culture began after the liberation from Japan in 1945. As a result, the vocabularies of Indo-European languages began to be widely adopted in trade-names, and even the manner of expression has been further westernized To evaluate the linguistic landscape of Korean cities, six cities and towns, that is, Seoul, Pusan, Mokpo, Youngdong, Dodong, were selected, and 4441 trade-names were obtained from donwtown streets. In the case of Seoul, besides the major central area, Myoungdong, other minor commercial centers were also selected mainly from residential areas. All data were collected from June through September of 1977. Identification of the origin of some words used in trade-names, which were apparently derived from a Western language, was very difficult, because those words are written in Korean characters only. Therefore, when it was still uncertain even after interviewing the owners of the shops, the trade-names were employed separately in classifying nationality. Foreign words, which have been adopted into the Korean sound system and written in Korean orthography, were classified as Korean. The results of the analysis of the data are: 1. The larger the city, the more complex the language used in trade-names. Foreign languages are used at a higher proportions in the big, international cities. 2. Metropolises, such as Seoul, with many specialized functions have various linguistic landscapes within a single city. Trade-names of the major city center are composed of foreign languages and letters at a higher rates, and the ones in the residential shopping centers use a higher proportion of Korean language. 3. The types of businesses have their influences on trade-names. Apparel shops adopt Indo-European languages for their signs at a higher rate. 4. In the process of borrowing foreign vocabulary, new words emerge quite frequently. 5. Foreign languages or borrowed foreign words tend to be used frequently in trade-names in accordance with the increasing contact with foreign cultures. 6. As a result of social stability due to recent economic development, as well as the growth of the Hangul generation composed of young people who were born after 1945, a movement of self-identity as a nation has begun to take place recently. In relation to this, the Korean language is adopted at an increasing rate in trade-names.",
